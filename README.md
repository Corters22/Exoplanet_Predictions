## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I created multiple machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Data

The full dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) through Kaggle. The data can be difficult to understand so I'm including a reference to the columns, https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html.
